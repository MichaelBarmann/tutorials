# Git \& GitHub Quick Reference

## 0\) What are Git and GitHub, and why do they matter?

**Git** is a version control system that keeps a history of your project as a sequence of snapshots called *commits*. It lets you see what changed, recover old versions, and organize your work as it evolves.

**GitHub** is a website that hosts Git repositories online. It provides backup, synchronization between machines, sharing, collaboration, and a convenient way to browse project history.

For PDE/ODE projects, Git provides a record of how solvers, notebooks, and utilities evolve over time.





\## Setting Up a New GitHub Repository



Use this when you already have a local folder and want to turn it into a GitHub repository.



\### 1. In PowerShell: go to the project folder



```powershell

code

cd 00\_notes

```



Check that you are in the right place:



```powershell

pwd

```



\### 2. Initialize Git locally



```powershell

git init

git branch -M main

```



\### 3. Add and commit files



```powershell

git status

git add .

git commit -m "Initial commit"

```



\### 4. On GitHub.com: create the repository



1\. Go to GitHub.

2\. Click \*\*New repository\*\*.

3\. Choose a repository name, for example:



```text

coding-notes

```



4\. Choose \*\*Public\*\* or \*\*Private\*\*.

5\. If you already have local files, do \*\*not\*\* add a README, `.gitignore`, or license on GitHub.

6\. Click \*\*Create repository\*\*.



\### 5. In PowerShell: connect local repo to GitHub



Replace `<username>` and `<repo-name>`:



```powershell

git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo-name>.git

```



Example:



```powershell

git remote add origin https://github.com/MichaelBarmann/coding-notes.git

```



Verify the remote:



```powershell

git remote -v

```



\### 6. Push to GitHub



```powershell

git push -u origin main

```



The `-u` sets `origin/main` as the default upstream branch, so future pushes can simply be:



```powershell

git push

```



> \[!TIP]

> ### Daily Workflow After Setup

>

> ```powershell

> git status

> git add .

> git commit -m "Describe changes"

> git push

> ```



\### If GitHub Already Added a File



If you created the GitHub repo with a README, `.gitignore`, or license, your first push may be rejected. Fix it with:



```powershell

git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

git push -u origin main

```



If Git says you are still merging, check:



```powershell

git status

```



Then conclude the merge:



```powershell

git add .

git commit -m "Merge remote files"

git push -u origin main

```

# 3\) Typical Workflow

## Creating a New File

```text
Create file
↓
git status
↓
git add file
↓
git commit -m "Add file"
↓
git push
```

## Modifying an Existing File

```text
Edit file
↓
git status
↓
git diff       (optional)
↓
git add file
↓
git diff --cached   (optional)
↓
git commit -m "Describe change"
↓
git push
```

## Renaming a File

```text
git mv old\_name new\_name
↓
git commit -m "Rename file"
↓
git push
```

# 4\) Key Points to Remember

* Git stores snapshots, not every keystroke.
* Only commits are saved permanently.
* A commit represents the state of the entire repository.
* New files are not tracked automatically.
* Use `git add` and commit them once.
* Tracked files stay tracked.
* Git automatically notices future modifications.
* `git add` does not create a commit; it stages changes.
* Nothing is permanently saved until you commit.
* Nothing is uploaded to GitHub until you push.
* `git status` is your best friend.
* Write meaningful commit messages.
* Commit at stable checkpoints.
* A clean repository is a happy repository.

# 5\) The Most Important Git Idea: A Commit is a Snapshot of the Entire Repository

A commit is not attached to a particular file. A commit is a snapshot of the entire repository at a particular moment in time.

Suppose the repository contains:

```text
Manifest.toml
ReadMe.md
notebooks/
    etd\_euler.ipynb
    phi\_functions.ipynb
```

## Commit A

```text
Manifest.toml          version 1
ReadMe.md             version 1
etd\_euler.ipynb       version 1
phi\_functions.ipynb   version 1
```

## Commit B

Only `etd\_euler.ipynb` changes:

```text
Manifest.toml          version 1
ReadMe.md             version 1
etd\_euler.ipynb       version 2
phi\_functions.ipynb   version 1
```

## Commit C

Only `ReadMe.md` changes:

```text
Manifest.toml          version 1
ReadMe.md             version 2
etd\_euler.ipynb       version 2
phi\_functions.ipynb   version 1
```

Git stores a sequence of repository snapshots:

```text
Commit A
    ↓
Commit B
    ↓
Commit C
```

When you run:

```powershell
git status
```

Git compares:

```text
Current repository state
        versus
Most recent commit
```

and reports which files differ.
